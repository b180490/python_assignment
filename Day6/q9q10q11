Q : What is Numpy and how it is better than list in python?

A ; NumPy Arrays are faster than Python Lists because of the following reasons:  

1 . An array is a collection of homogeneous data-types that are stored in contiguous memory locations. On the other hand, a list in Python is a collection of heterogeneous data types stored in non-contiguous memory locations.



2 . The NumPy package breaks down a task into multiple fragments and then processes all the fragments parallelly.



3 .The NumPy package integrates C, C++, and Fortran codes in Python. These programming languages have very little execution time compared to Python.
