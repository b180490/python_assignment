Q5 : What is numpy and how it is better than list in python? What are ways of creating 1D, 2D
and 3D arrays in numpy?

A : numPy Arrays are faster than Python Lists because of the following reasons:

1. An array is a collection of homogeneous
data-types that are stored in contiguous memory
locations. On the other hand, a list in Python
is a collection of heterogeneous data types
stored in non-contiguous memory locations.

2. The NumPy package breaks down a task into
multiple fragments and then processes all the
fragments parallelly.


3. The NumPy package integrates C, C++, and
Fortran codes in Python. These programming
languages have very little execution time
compared to Python.


1D array creation :
import numpy as np
one_dimensional_list = [1,2,4]
one_dimensional_arr = np.array(one_dimensional_list)
print("1D array is : ",one_dimensional_arr)

2D array creation :
import numpy as np
two_dimensional_list=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
two_dimensional_arr = np.array(two_dimensional_list)
print("2D array is : ",two_dimensional_arr)

3D array creation :
import numpy as np
three_dimensional_list=[[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]]
three_dimensional_arr = np.array(three_dimensional_list)
print("3D array is : ",three_dimensional_arr)






Q6 :  Can we have public, private, protected, static in Python classes?

A  :  Python supports three types of access
modifiers which are public,private and
protected. These access modifiers provide
restrictions on the access of member variables
and methods of the class from any object
outside the class.
